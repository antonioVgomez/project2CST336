This is tailored to be a place where if someone wanted to know about certain athletes from various time periods they could.
I tried to present a simple display and easy to use UI that wasnt all over the place.
Users can read what I used to make this site. They will also presented some links for references and alos learn about some athletes.
Users should be able to go over certain athletes without refreshing the page. I even add the youtube api to see if I know to use it right on top of my own.
I explored some features I didnt learn in class like pop over bootstrap and  adding images to my db.



From an admins perspective I was looking to do a type of wikipedia page.
Where someone would be able to come in and add athletes as they want or update the
information on current athletes in the database. Additionaly admins can delete users something 
I wish I could have gotten to in time but I just found that task quite hard.
